# FashionStore
[Angular Project] A fashion store for users to buy products online

This project is an ecommerce webstore which makes use of Angular's components to separate it into 
components that can be reused and still dynamically retrieves data as need be. 
It uses Javascript to make calls to the PHP scripting which send HTTP requests to the server to retrieve data
Angular is used to load this data dynamically and thereby making it great for large scale stores with single or multiple pages
Data is then loaded into the cart with the help of VanillarJS and Angular 
And a complex VanillaJS algorithm ensures classes are used correctly and should they change Angular's dependencie injection is used
to ensure classes do not affect the ecommerce store dramatically
